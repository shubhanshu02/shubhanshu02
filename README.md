### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shubhanshu. I have been tinkering with computers since grade 7. My interest in low-level Windows features, such as the registry, led me to discover my love for computer science, and I have been building my skills ever since. I love the fact that our interests may change overtime, and that's why we get bumped into different things.

As a backend engineer, I am particularly interested in building software that provides a solid infrastructure for user-facing applications.
